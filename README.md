# TravelAssistant-Project-1-

This is my first project when I was in university. It's called Travel Assistant and written in C++.It uses Dijkstra algorithm to calculate shortest path from one city to others.
Besides,I expended this problem by adding some features to it such as suggesting things like weather,local sightseeing,cuisine,....
I got A with this project and when I finished,I did realize what C++ actually can do.
I hope you like this :D
Thank you <3
